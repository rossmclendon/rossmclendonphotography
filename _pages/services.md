## Portraits
$250[^1]

For a typical portrait session, I'll meet you at a time (an hour before sunset is best for outdoors) and location we've discussed that's within a 45-minute drive of Warwick, RI.  We'll shoot for about an hour.  Within a couple of weeks, I'll send you a link where you can download the full-resolution digital images from your shoot - I'd estimate 20-30 images.  You'll have full license to print these images and use them personally.  If the shoot location is farther than a 45 minute drive, or you want to do things like shoot at multiple locations or change outfits which will make the shoot run longer than an hour and lead to more images, then it may be a bit more.  We can discuss this ahead of time.

## Weddings
$1500[^1]

**A typical wedding photography experience:**
I arrive at your wedding venue around an hour before the ceremony starts to get the lay of the land and capture images of things like decorations and candids of the bride and groom getting ready, assuming that's happening at the same location as the ceremony.  During the ceremony, I capture once-in-a-lifetime moments as you walk down the aisle, say "I Do," and become husband and wife.  After the ceremony, we spend about half an hour working through a list of 10 or so formal family portraits you'd like shot at the ceremony location.  If the light is right, we then take time to shoot portraits of the two of you or the the whole wedding party somewhere convenient to the ceremony and reception.  At the reception, I capture your entry and first dance, then snag a quick bite to eat and catch my breath before documenting the cutting of the cake and the action on the dance floor along with other interesting thigns going on.  About two hours after arriving at the reception, My work as picture-taker is done and I head home to get images off cameras and find a few highlights to send you within in a couple of days so you can share some images of your awesome wedding!  Within a month you get a link with several hundred full-resolution images to print and share with family and friends that will help you remember this beautiful day as the anniversaries roll on.

## Real Estate
 $150 up to 2 bedrooms, +$25 for each additional bedroom[^1]
 
 You've worked with your realtor (or with your client) to get the property looking it's best, including tidying up all the spaces that will be photographed indoors and out.  I arrive at the scheduled time with camera, tripod, and a few lights and work my way through each room over the course of an hour or two (depending on the size of the property), finishing up with some outside shots.  Within 48 hours I provide you two sets of images - one full-resoluation and another sized for MLS - which will make your property stand out among a sea of listings shot on smartphones.
