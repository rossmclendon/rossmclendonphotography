[Contact me]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) if you would like to purchase a print.
## Images
Here are many of my images which are available as prints.
### Standard Print Sizes
These are images that are available cropped to standard sizes.
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
{% for image in site.static_files %}
    {% if image.path contains 'images/prints/standard' %}
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ image.path }}" alt="image" />
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</div>

### Panoramic Prints
Panoramas are a feast for the eyes containing incredible amounts of detail.
<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
{% for image in site.static_files %}
    {% if image.path contains 'images/prints/panorama' %}
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ image.path }}" alt="image" />
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</div>

If there is an image from my Instagram or Facebook feed you're intersted in and you don't see here, let me know and most likely I can arrange to make a print of it.

## Pricing
My prints are each hand-signed and numbered in limited runs, and as such are exempt from sales tax in the state of Rhode Island.  Shipping can be arranged at an additional cost.

### Paper Prints

| Size       |  Matted | Framed  |
|------------|:-------:|:-------:|
| 5" × 7"    |   $40   |   $60   |
| 8" × 10"   |   $75   |  $100   |
| 11" × 14"  |  $125   |  $185   |
| 16" × 20"  |  $250   |  $350   |
| Panoramas  | Inquire | Inquire |

Prints on paper come matted in a white mat to fit a frame the next size up (for instance, a matted 8" × 10" print would go in an 11" × 14" frame).  The print size includes a 1/2 inch margin, so for example, the printed area of an 8" × 10" print is actually 7" × 9".  Framed prints come in a standard black gallery frame.

### Metal Prints

Metal Prints are offered in 16"x20" for $500 and come without frame, ready to be mounted on your wall.
