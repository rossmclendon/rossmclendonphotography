## Images
Here are many of my images which are available as prints.
### Standard Print Sizes
These are images that are available cropped to standard sizes.
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
{% for image in site.static_files %}
    {% if image.path contains 'images/prints/standard' %}
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ image.path }}" alt="image" />
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</div>

### Panoramic Prints
Panoramas are a feast for the eyes containing incredible amounts of detail.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="2">
{% for image in site.static_files %}
    {% if image.path contains 'images/prints/panorama' %}
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ image.path }}" alt="image" />
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</div>

If there is an image from my Instagram or Facebook feed you're intersted in and you don't see here, let me know and most likely I can arrange to make a print of it.

## Pricing
My prints are each hand-signed and numbered in limited runs, and as such are exempt from sales tax in the state of Rhode Island.  Shipping can be arranged at an additional cost.

### Paper Prints
Prints on paper come matted in a white mat to fit a frame the next size up (for instance, a matted 8" × 10" print would go in an 11" × 14" frame).  The print size includes a 1/2 inch margin, so for example, the printed area of an 8" × 10" print is actually 7" × 9".  The print number, title, and the signature are included in the margin.  Framed prints come in a standard black gallery frame.

### Metal Prints
Metal prints come at the listed size with the printed area extending all the way to the edge with rounded corners, are signed and numbered on the back, and include a hidden metal frame for hanging on the back such that they will sit about 3/4-1" away from the wall for a modern, minimalist aesthetic.
