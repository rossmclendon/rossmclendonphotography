## Images
If there is an image from my Instagram or Facebook feed you're intersted in and you don't see here, let me know and most likely I can arrange to make a print of it.

Prints come matted in a white mat to fit a frame the next size up (for instance, a matted 8" × 10" print would go in an 11" × 14" frame).  The print size includes a 1/2 inch margin, so for example, the printed area of an 8" × 10" print is actually 7" × 9".  Framed prints come in a basic black gallery frame.  My prints are each hand-signed and numbered in limited runs, and as such are exempt from sales tax in the state of Rhode Island.  Shipping can be arranged at an additional cost.
