## Ross McLendon

Hi.  I'm Ross. I've always enjoyed taking photos, but I got started seriously with photography back in 2016 when I bought a used DSLR at my local camera repair shop in Warwick so that I could get better photos of my kids.  Long story short, I got a few decent images and caught the photogrpahy bug.  As time went on, I discovered that like music (I'm an avid vocalist), photography sits at a nexus of things technical and artistic in a way that I really enjoy.  I dove into learning and practice (as well as convincing my skeptical family that yes, I really *did* need that expensive lens) and to this day I rarely go out the door without my camera bag slung over my shoulder, constantly seeking opportunities to squeeze a bit of landscape photography into my schedule and capturing beautiful things here in New England as I come across them.  I'm always learning, but I've developed enough experience and confidence to turn my hobby into a side-hustle (I have a full-time job during the week).  Hence this website.

When I'm not out with a camera, I'm probably wearing one of a few other hats.  I work at [Dassault Syst√®mes](https://www.3ds.com/) where I'm part of a team developing an application to calibrate computational material models to match physical material behavior for use in engineering mechanics simulations (stuff like crashing virtual cars into a virtual wall).  I'm also responsible for the [FE-RVE Micromechanics Plugin for Abaqus/CAE](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/micromechanics-plugin-abaqus-ross-mclendon/) there.  You can read more about my engineering mechanics background on my [Linkedn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ross-mclendon-29780b1/).  I'm also an active member at [Grace Harbor Church](https://graceharbor.net/) in Providence where I recently completed a term as deacon of music, helping manage things like sound and - in the season of COVID-19 - video.  I'm a bass in [The Providence Singers](http://providencesingers.org/).  And my most important hats - I'm the father of four wonderful children and husband to an amazing, beautiful woman named Meredith.
