So if you're new hear and looking through the blog, know that I'm new here, too.  Everything is new here, actually (at least at the time of writing this) as I just created this website.  So hi.  

Really quick - I'm [Ross](/about).  I've been at it in photography for a while now and am to the point where I'm confident I can start making photos for other people that are good enough I'm comfortable charging modest rates to do so.  I haven't really had a website of my own before, but I'm too cost-conscious to pay a monthly fee for something like [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) (although I hear that's a great tool for website-building), so I asked a few web-developer-type friends, learned a bit about [Jekyll and Markdown](https://jekyllrb.com/), bought the [Board](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/board-portfolio-jekyll-theme) theme from [here](https://jekyllthemes.io/), and got hacking (that might be a blog post for another day).  And here were are, with you reading my blog.  I think that's pretty cool!

And that brings us to the part where I try to make the sale.  Why should you pay me to make photos for you.  Well, there might be a few reasons.  First, you might like the photos I make.  Have a look through my [portfolios](/portfolio), particularly the one for [portriture](/portfolios/portraiture).  Those are examples of images I've made for friends and some of my own kids (my wife Meredith and I have four).  Second, I realize that presently (as of late 2020) I'm still pretty new in the pay-me-to-make-your-photos space, so I've tried to price myself accordingly, a bit below what I see other folks charging.  In addition to that, I'm not really the sort that wants to upsell you on this and that picture and prints and digital files.  There are some great photographers who separate their sitting fee and the cost of image products, and that's fine, but it's not the way I really want to do things.  Trust me, I've felt the knot in my stomach when I realized that getting the images I liked from the kids photo session I thought was going to cost $300-400 is really going to run into 4-figure territory.  So I'm going to be up-front with pricing, I'm going to give you an assortment of full-resolution digital images to enjoy at the end of everything, and I'll happily make recommendations of places to go get them professionally printed (I personally use [MPix](https://www.mpix.com/) and a local shop called [iolabs](https://www.iolabsinc.com/)).  If you really want me to, I can handle getting prints made, but I'm just as happy for you to leave it to photography print experts like these (I'd generally suggest avoiding your neighborhood pharmacy or big-box-store, as you're likely to end up with pictures that make you look jauniced or smurf-like).

Anyways, that's probably enough for this post.  If you'd like to get in touch to line up a portrait shoot, just shoot me a message via my fancy [contact]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) page and I'll get in touch with you soon.  Thanks for visiting my site, and whomever you end up using for your portraits, I hope you end up with images you love!
