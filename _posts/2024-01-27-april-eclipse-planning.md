I'll be editing this blog post as time allows with information that's hopefully helpful for folks as we get closer to April 8.

*August 21, 2017 Ecplise*

In case you haven't heard, there's going to be a total eclipse of the sun on April 8, 2024 that crosses much of the United States (as well as parts of Mexico and Canada).

# Introduction
Total solar eclipses are an amazing natural spectacle - the most amazing one I have yet to see, and 2nd place isn't even close.  I've written a bit about overall planning [on my personal blog](https://rossmclendon.com/April8EclipsePlanning/).  This post focuses on photography.

The first question you need to ask yourself is whether you *should* photograph the eclipse.  I've heard many eclipse veterans give the following piece of very sound advice. 
>If this is your first total eclipse, watch it. Don't photograph it.<br> - *Lots of eclipse veterans*

I heard this advice leading up to 2017, and I ignored it. Wellm, maybe I didn't ignore it - I did consider what's at the heart of it - making sure that you actually *experience* totality.  I'd wager most anyone who's into photography can relate to the fact that photography can take you out of the moment.  An experience becomes different when you put a camera between it and yourself.  This is amplified as the photogrpahy task becomes more challenging.  A total eclipse is exceedingly rare, very brief, and very dynamic.  It's an experience you don't want to miss because you're messing with cameras, just like if you were attending a loved one's wedding you wouldn't sit there in your chair watching the ceremony livestream on your phone.  So, given that what's at the heart of this advice is to not let photography mess up the experience of seeing a total solar eclipse, my personal advice is slightly different.
>Don't mess with cameras during the total phase of a solar eclipse.<br> - *Me*

We'll talk more about it later, but I'll give a little spoiler here at the outset to say that the key to this is *automation*.  If you're willing to put in some planning and work to automate image capture, you can enjoy totality with your own two eyes while your cameras (hopefully) snaps away.  If you don't think that's something you're up for investing the time to do, then I'd suggest you pass on photography - especially if you've never experienced totality before - and instead enjoy the most amazing show I think the natural world has to offer.  At the very least, put a priority on experiencing it and set some ground rules to put photography at a distant second like giving yourself 20 seconds to troubleshoot any issue that comes up during totality (which is close to 10% of the total time you'd have to experience totality on the centerline).
            
# Photography
If after reading that, you're set on photographing the eclipse, here are nuggets I've gathered from my meager experience in 2017 and extensive research.

## Equipment
You can get away with just a camera, lens, and (for the partial phases) filter, but you'll be helped by having other things I'll discuss below.

### Focal Lengths
This depends on the phase and what you're focusing on, but in general you'll want long lenses.  The sun is small in the sky, and will come close to filling the frame at an equivalent full-frame focal length of about 2000mm.  However, the corona is *much* larger than the bright photosphere that the moon will cover up, so if you're planning to capture the corona (and you should be planning to capture the corona), you'll want something quite a bit wider than what makes a good filtered-solar-disk image.  300mm on full-frame is a pretty good target for the corona - in 2017 I shot totality witha 200mm lens on a crop-sensor camera body (320mm full-frame equivalent), and that seemed like a pretty good focal length for getting the broad corona.  That said, I've seen [corona images taken with focal lengths as (relatively) wide as 85mm](https://hdr-astrophotography.com/2019-eclipse-large-field-of-view/) that I find very striking.

There's also a broader story to tell about experiencing the eclipse.  Wide angle is useful for that - especially since totality will be very high in the sky for most of the path - around Dallas, for instance, the fully-eclipsed sun will be about 65º above the horizon (i.e. you'll need a *very* wide lens to show both foreground *and* the eclipsed sun).

### Video
Video can make a neat medium for much of what happens in an eclipse.  In 2017 we directed a video camera at our group to capture our reaction to totality, and it's a video I still enjoy re-watching.

### Other Equipment To Consider
 - **Tripod** - Get a solid tripod to get sharp images at high magnification.
 - **Viewing/Framing Aids** - Things like tilting screens or angle finders for your camera are very helpful when it's pointed high in the sky.
 - **Shutter Remote** - You need some sort of remote shutter, as pressing your shutter button will shake your camera.
 - **Solar Filters** - Needed for partial phases; I discuss this more in the partial phase section below.
 - **Tracking Mount** - discussed below.
 - **Canopy** - You'll appreciate having some sort of shade to retreat to.
 - **Solar Eclipse Glasses** - So you can quickly look to see how things are progressing without ruining your eyes - get reputable ones.
 - **Computer and accessories** - If you're going to automate with a computer, make sure you can power it through the whole eclipse.  Also consider what might help you with using it outside like a table and some sort of screen shade.
 
### Dealing with the Rotating Earth
The earth rotates 360º relative to the sun every 24 hours, or about ¼º every minute.  The sun itself is about ½º across in the sky.  This means every two minutes, the sun will move one sun-width across the frame of a stationary camera.  If your camera is fixed on a tripod with a long focal length, this can mean a **lot** of reframing over the course of an eclipse, potentially including during the few minutes of totality.  Keeping the sun in frame was my least favorite part of photographing the 2017 eclipse.  Additionally, if you're shooting long focal lengths during totality, this motion can introduce blur for some of the longer shutter durations you might use for capturing earthshine and the outer corona.
This year, I'm planning to use a motorized equitorial mount.  I expect it's going to make my life a lot easier than in 2017 when I just had my lens on a decent ball head.  The one trick is polar aligning the mount during the day.  I know I can't get it perfect unless I set up the night before when I can dial it into Polaris, but I'm hoping that if I can get it pretty close, I won't have to futz with re-framing too much.  I can't really give advice here as I don't have experience with this yet (I'll be practicing this process in the coming weeks), but I can say this was one of my greatest annoyances in 2017.  I may also have a go using the SkyWatcher SolarQuest - although it's probalby a good idea to cover its optical sensor a little while before and after totality so that it doesn't get thrown off (I've not tested it in these conditions).

## Capturing Eclispe Phases
Eclipses are denoted by four main events:
 - **C1** - The lunar disk begins to cover the sun - the start of the ***partial*** phase.
 - **C2** - The last bit of the photosphere (the bright part of the sun) disappers behind the moon.  This is the start of ***totality***.
 - **C3** - The photosphere reappars from behind the sun.  End of totalty, back to the partial phase.
 - **C4** - The last bit of the lunar disk passes from the solar disk.  Eclipse is over. Traffic jams abound.
Note that **C2** and **C3** only apply if you're in the path of totality.  Otherwise you'll only experience **C1** and **C4**.

### Partial Phases
The partial phases of the eclipse run from C1 to C2, and from C3 to C4.  If you're not in the path of totality (no C2 or C3) then everything you experience will be a partial phase.

There's a good bit to say here, but for now, I'll just reiterate the important safety advice that **you *must* have a proper solar filter as the *first* optical element in your camera setup** if you're using any sort of long focal length.  Even at wide angles, you might put your equipement at risk if you leave the sun in frame for a longer period of time.  Blindness and equipment damage can happen if you fail to follow this guidance.  Rear filters are no good because the lens will concentrate solar energy on them which will be dissipated *inside* your equipment, likely burning or melting through the filter.  Similarly, regular ND filters - even very dark ones like 10- or 15-stop NDs - that aren't designed for solar viewing may allows non-visible spectrum through like IR and UV that you can't see but which can be extremely damaging.  If you doubt the possibility for equipment damage, have a look at [Lens Rentals' blog article from after the 2017 eclipse](https://www.lensrentals.com/blog/2017/09/rental-camera-gear-destroyed-by-the-solar-eclipse-of-2017/).  The lead picture there of a $10,000+ Canon EF 600mm f4L IS ii with melted iris blades should give any photographer pause.

For partial phases, you want as long a focal length as you can get as the only interesting part through a solar filter is the disk of the photosphere (the bright part of the sun we can usually see).  The sun is very small in the sky - about 0.5º or 30 arc-minutes across.  Sharpness of your images will depend on your lens, how well you focus, and atmospheric distortion (called *seeing* in the astronomy world).  With any solar filter, you'll be able to see features like sunspots, which are likely to be present on April 8 since we're in a solar maximum.  Different solar filters will give the sun different colors - some white, some yellow/orange.  There are glass filters and film filters of various materials out there which do the job of reducing the solar intenisty to a safe level.  Here's an example with a [Thousand Oaks "Full Aperture" filter](https://thousandoaksoptical.com/shop/solar-filters/full-aperture-solarlite-polymer/) on an old manual 500mm f4.5 lens w/ a 1.4x teleconverter.  The shutter speed was 1/40s, ISO was 400, and I can't exactly recall the f-stop but I *think* it was maybe f/8 (manual lenses don't record their f-stop with the exif data).

Of the various filter options out there, a few thoughts to consider...

 - Thin film filters will be more forgiving optically when put in front of telephoto optics.
 - Glass filters are more robust and easier to clean without damaging them.
 - You'll need to quickly remove your filter at the start of totality and quickly replace it at the end, which can be challenging with threaded filters.
 - It's possible to purchase solar filter material in bulk and fashion your own filter.
 
In 2017, I purchased a simple [cardboard full-aperture filter](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/buy/universal-solar-filters/).  It performed well and was quite affordable.

#### H-Alpha Filtering
If you want to spice things up, you could consider investing in H-alpha equipment.  These are special filters designed to transmit very specific frequencies of light.  While a regular solar filter blocks almost all of the light coming into the camera/telescope, H-α blocks all light except for a very narrow band with a wavelength of 656.28 nm - think of just letting in a tiny slice of the rainbow.  This light comes from the sun's chromosphere and contains a great deal of detail that is normally washed out by the other spectra of light emitted by the sun.

This isn't just another filter you put on your lens - generally you do H-alpha imaging with dedicated telescopes and monochrome cameras.  Good H-alpha solar imagery is a major field in and of itself.

### Totality
Totality runs from C2 to C3, assuming you're in the path.
![August 21, 2017 Ecplise]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/2024-02-19-photographing-eclipse/august_17_eclipse_composite.jpg)

This is when you take your lens filter off.  **Don't forget to take your lens filters off**.  I've heard this from multiple folks who photographed totality (or tried to) in 2017 and learned this lesson the hard way.  Give youself some queue to remind yourself.

#### Features of interest
There are several different things to watch for during totality.

##### Bailey's Beads and Diamond Ring
This is the last bit of bright photosphere peeking between mountains and valleys on the lunar limb (the edge of the moon) at C2.  You also get the same effect on the other side of the lunar disk as the   You should take your **camera** filter off at this point, **but leave your solar glasses on**.  Also, very important - **DO NOT LOOK THROUGH AN OPTICAL VIEWFINDER WHEN PHOTOGRAPHING THIS PHASE WITH AN UNFILTERED CAMERA** - use live view instead.  Any time any part of the photosphere is visible - even the little sliver associated with Bailey's Beads - your eyes need protection to look at it directly.

##### Prominences
Once you take the solar filter off your camera, you'll see prominences protruding away from the sun beyond the lunar limb.  Long focal lengths are best for these.  Because they typically only extend a short distance from the sun, they are most visible just after totality starts and just before totality ends

##### Earthshine
While it's not really visible to the unaided eye, long exposures will pick up detail of the moon's surface which is illuminated by light reflected off the earth.

##### Stars
You'll be able to see stars during totality.  In 2017, Regulus with its bright apparent magnitude of 1.4 was quite close to the sun.  In 2024, Epsilon Piscium will be the brightest star in close proximity to the sun with an apparent magnitude of 4.3.  This is *much* dimmer than Regulus is, so don't expect any dramatically bright stars in the frame immediately around the sun this year, but stars should be visible in more brightly exposed images.

##### The Corona
This is really why we care about total eclipses.  The sun's corona is always there, but normally invisible to us because it is many times dimmer than the bright photosphere which, along with Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere, completely washes it out.  It's incredibly beautiful.  It looks different in every eclipse depending on the highly variable magnetic field lines of the sun.  It has extreme variation in brightness as it extends away from the sun which necessitates HDR photography techniques to really capture well.  It extends away from the sun many times the diameter of the photosphere, so to capture it, you'll want a much wider field of view than you'd want for photogrpahing partial phases (or potentially several different fields of view).  I personally have some plans for 2024 based on some imagery I've seen using focal lengths [as wide as 85mm](https://hdr-astrophotography.com/2019-eclipse-large-field-of-view/).  If you have to choose a single focal length, 300-500mm on full-frame is probably a good option.

#### Exposures During Totality
This is the bit of the blog that's probalby most helpful for new solar eclipse photographers since you can't practice shooting a total eclipse unitl it happens.  The corona is extremely dynamic, very bright toward the center and dimly extending out many times the diameter of the sun's photosphere (the bright part).  I took a bunch of exposures during totality in 2017.  I put them together into a video along with the exposure info.  Each photo here is rendered from Lightroom without any adjustments using a very neutral profile to give the best possible representation of how a given exposure renders the various eclipse detail.

## Automation
The key to following my advice in the introduction and getting good images of totality is *automation*.  If you can automate the capture of different exposures at different times, then you can enjoy totality while your cameras click away without you having to mess with them during those precious moments.  A few options to consider:
 - **Intervalometer + Bracketing** - You can set up your camera to shoot bracketed exposures and then drive those with an intervalometer (interval timer) that you start right as totality begins.  This might be the easiest thing, but will make it a little tricky to capture things like Bailey's Beads that need quite different exposures than the corona.
 - [**Solar Eclipse Maestro**](http://xjubier.free.fr/en/site_pages/solar_eclipses/Solar_Eclipse_Maestro_Photography_Software.html) - I used this in 2017, but, apparently some of the libraries that this tool used are no longer supported and so it hasn't been developed for some time.  As a result, support tops out at macOS 10.14.x (Mojave), so unless you have an old Mac lying around you're willing to trust for the eclipse, it's not an option today.
 - [**CaptureEclipse**](https://almadenobservatory.net/CaptureEclipse/) - This is freely avialable on Apple's [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/captureeclipse/id1567295651) and supports modern MacOS versions.  Rob Hawley created it for his own needs after Solar Eclipse Maestro went out of support and was kind enough to share it.  It only supports (most) Canon cameras, and doesn't allow as fine-grained control as Solar Eclipse Maestro did - there are pre-programmed exposure sequences it runs through for each phase whereas SEM let you specify exactly what exposure you wanted to take when.  It also only supports one camera as best I can tell whereas SEM supported four.  Still, if you're on mac, use Canon, and want a turnkey option, this may be your best choice. 
 - **Home-rolled program** - I'm familiar with programming, so I downloaded the Canon EDSDK and am currently writing a program to drive multiple cameras.  It won't have a fancy GUI or options to automatically calculate eclipse phases from GPS coordinates in the program, but I'm hoping to make it reasonably general. Not sure I'll distribute it, though.  I think most of the other major camera makers provide SDKs for controlling their cameras as well.
 
## Practice
Practice as much as you can.  Run through any automation you're going to do a few times to make sure you're getting all the exposures you expect to get.  Figure out what happens if a battery dies or a USB cable gets unplugged right before totality.  Does your camera refocus?  Do you have to restart some program?  When do you take off your filters?  How long does that take?  Have a plan and checklist.  You only get one shot at totality - if you're experimenting and improvising you'll likely not get photos and you'll likely be distrated from enjoying the experience.  The next total eclipse to cross the United States like this won't be unitl 2045.

## Post-processing
This is a huge topic in and of itself.  I'll just refer to a few resources on the topic here.
 - **[The "Pellett" Method](https://www.astropix.com/html/processing/e_comp.html)** - My 2017 image borrowed from this technique.  The linked page inlcudes a good discussion of various methods.
 - **The [work](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006CoSka..36..131D/abstract) of M. Druckmüller** - a professor in Slovakia, he and [his daughter](https://www.vut.cz/en/students/final-thesis/detail/69016) have contributed considerably to the topic of corona imagery post-processing
 - **[Nicolas Lefaudeux](https://hdr-astrophotography.com/solar-eclipses/)** - I greatly admire his work, which he indicates borrows heavily from Druckmüller.

## Other photography pointers
 - Turn off image stabilization if you're using a tripod.
 - At the very least, use a remote shutter release rather than pressing the shutter button on your camera.
 - It's probably best to use manual focus.  Punch in to 10x in live view to set it.  Note that glass filters might result in slightly different focus and necessitate a re-focus after you take them off at totality (in which case maybe do use autofocus, or use a film filter instead).
 - Shoot in uncompressed (lossless) raw and use as close to your camera's native ISO as your aperture will allow to get a good shutter speed.  You'll want every bit of dynamic range your camera will give you for the corona, and uncompressed raw formats generally yield somewhat better shadow detail recover than lossy compressed raw formats (and much better than shooting in .jpeg).
 - Make sure you're shooting with a fast enough shutter speed to freeze the moon and sun, especially if you're shooting very long focal lengths on a static tripod.  This is less of a concern if you're on a tracking mount of some sort.
 - Make sure to clean your sensors (or have them cleaned) beforehand.  Dust spots can greatly complicate corona HDR post-processing.
   
# Other Matters
*A few things to consider beyond photography.*

## Traffic
The [post](https://rossmclendon.com/April8EclipsePlanning/) on my personal blog talks about this more, but be ready for extreme traffic jams immediately following the eclipse, especially if you traveled from a population center to get to the path of totality.  Bring along a full tank of gas, some snacks, and plenty of patience, or plan to spend the night before heading out the next day.  Also give yourself lots of extra time before the eclipse to get to your viewing location.  You can't control traffic, nor can you control the movement of planets, moons, and stars.  If you're late, you miss it.

## Deeper Questions
Whether you photograph this event or not, I hope you enjoy it.  And in the midst of all the beauty and technical photography, don't forget to think about [deeper questions](https://rossmclendon.com/April8EclipsePlanning/#a-deeper-meaning) like *why* the moon blocking the sun is so beautiful.
