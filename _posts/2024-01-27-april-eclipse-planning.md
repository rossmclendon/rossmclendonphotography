*August 21, 2017 Ecplise*

In case you haven't heard, there's going to be a total eclipse of the sun on April 8, 2024 that crosses much of the United States (as well as parts of Mexico and Canada).

# Introduction
Total solar eclipses are an amazing natural spectacle - the most amazing one I have yet to see, and 2nd place isn't even close.  I've written a bit about overall planning [on my personal blog](https://rossmclendon.com/April8EclipsePlanning/).  This post focuses on photography.

The first question you need to ask yourself is whether you *should* photograph the eclipse.  I've heard many eclipse veterans give the following piece of very sound advice. 
>If this is your first total eclipse, watch it. Don't photograph it.<br> - *Lots of eclipse veterans*

I didn't follow this recommendation in 2017, but I think it's good advice if you consider what's at the heart of it.  I'd wager that most anyone who's into photography can relate to the fact that photography can take you out of the moment.  An experience becomes different when you put a camera between it and yourself.  This is amplified as the photogrpahy task becomes more challenging.  A total eclipse is exceedingly rare, very brief, and very dynamic.  It's an experience you don't want to miss because you're messing with cameras, just like if you were attending a loved one's wedding you wouldn't sit there in your chair watching the ceremony livestream on your phone.  So, given that what's at the heart of this advice is to not let photography mess up the experience of seeing a total solar eclipse, My personal advice is slightly differnt.
>Don't mess with cameras during the total phase of a solar eclipse.<br> - *Me*

We'll talk more about it later, but I'll give a little spoiler here at the outset to say that the key to this is *automation*.  If you're willing to put in some planning and work to automate image capture, you can enjoy totality with your own two eyes while your cameras (hopefully) snap away.  If you don't think that's something you're up for doing, then I'd suggest you pass on photography - especially if you've never experienced totality before - and enjoy the most amazing show I think the natural world has to offer.
            
# Photography
If you're set on photographing the eclipse, here are nuggets I've gathered from my meager experience and extensive research.

## Equipment
You can get away with just a camera, lens, and filter for the partial phases, but you'll be helped by having other things.

### Things To Consider
 - Get a solid tripod to get sharp images at high magnification.
 - Things like tilting screens or angle finders for your camera are very helpful.
 - You need some sort of remote shutter, as pressing your shutter button will shake your camera.
 
### Dealing with the Rotating Earth
The earth rotates 360º relative to the sun every 24 hours, or about ¼º every minute.  The sun itself is about ½º across in the sky.  This means every two minutes, the sun will move one sun width across the frame of a stationary camera.  If your camera is fixed on a tripod with a long focal length, this can mean a **lot** of reframing over the course of an eclipse, potentially including during the few minutes of totality.  Keeping the sun in frame was my least favorite part of photographing the 2017 eclipse.
This year, I have a motorized equitorial mount.  I expect it's going to make my life a lot easier.  The one trick is polar aligning it during the day.  I know I can't get it perfect, but I'm hoping that if I can get it pretty close, I won't have to futz with re-framing too much.  I can't really give advice here as I don't have experience with this, but I'm working on a plan based on my experience in 2017.  I may also have a go using the SkyWatcher SolarQuest - although it's probalby a good idea to cover its optical sensor a little while before and after totality so that it doesn't get thrown off (I've not tested it in these conditions).

## Capturing Eclispe Phases
Eclipses are denoted by four main events:
 - **C1** - The lunar disk begins to cover the sun - the start of the ***partial*** phase.
 - **C2** - The last bit of the photosphere (the bright part of the sun) disappers behind the moon.  This is the start of ***totality***.
 - **C3** - The photosphere reappars from behind the sun.  End of totalty, back to the partial phase.
 - **C4** - The last bit of the lunar disk passes from the solar disk.  Eclipse is over. Traffic jams abound.
Note that **C2** and **C3** only apply if you're in the path of totality.  Otherwise you'll only experience **C1** and **C4**.

### Partial Phases
The partial phases of the eclipse run from C1 to C2, and from C3 to C4.  If you're not in the path of totality (no C2 or C3) then everything you experience will be a partial phase.

There's a good bit to say here, but for now, I'll just reiterate the important safety advice that **you *must* have a proper solar filter as the *first* optical element in your camera setup** if you're using any sort of long focal length.  Even at wide angles, you might put your equipement at risk if you leave the sun in frame for a longer period of time.  Blindness and equipment damage can happen if you fail to follow this guidance.  Rear filters are no good because the lens will concentrate solar energy on them which will be dissipated *inside* your equipment, likely burning or melting through the filter.  Similarly, regular ND filters - even very dark ones like 10- or 15-stop NDs - that aren't designed for solar viewing may allows non-visible spectrum through like IR and UV that you can't see but which can be extremely damaging.  If you doubt the possibility for equipment damage, have a look at [Lens Rentals' blog article from after the 2017 eclipse](https://www.lensrentals.com/blog/2017/09/rental-camera-gear-destroyed-by-the-solar-eclipse-of-2017/).  The lead picture there of a $10,000+ Canon EF 600mm f4L IS ii with melted iris blades should give any photographer pause.

For partial phases, you want as long a focal length as you can get as the only interesting part through a solar filter is the disk of the photosphere (the bright part of the sun we can usually see).  The sun is very small in the sky - about 0.5º or 30 arc-minutes across.  Sharpness of your images will depend on your lens, how well you focus, and atmospheric distortion (called *seeing* in the astronomy world).  With any solar filter, you'll be able to see features like sunspots, which are likely to be present on April 8 since we're in a solar maximum.

#### H-Alpha Filtering
If you want to spice things up, you could consider investing in H-alpha equipment.  These are special filters designed to transmit very specific frequencies of light.  While a regular solar filter blocks almost all of the light coming into the camera/telescope, H-α blocks all light except for a very narrow band with a wavelength of 656.28 nm - think of just letting in a tiny slice of the rainbow.  This light comes from the sun's chromosphere and contains a great deal of detail that is normally washed out by the other spectra of light emitted by the sun.

This isn't just another filter you put on your lens - generally you do H-alpha imaging with dedicated telescopes and monochrome cameras.  Good H-alpha solar imagery is a major field in and of itself.

### Totality
Totality runs from C2 to C3, assuming you're in the path.
![August 21, 2017 Ecplise]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/2024-02-19-photographing-eclipse/august_17_eclipse_composite.jpg)

This is when you take your lens filter off.  **Don't forget to take your lens filters off**.  I've heard this from multiple folks who photographed totality (or tried to) in 2017 and learned this lesson the hard way.  Give youself some queue to remind yourself.

#### Features of interest
There are several different things to watch for during totality.

##### Bailey's Beads and Diamond Ring
This is the last bit of bright photosphere peeking between mountains and valleys on the lunar limb (the edge of the moon) at C2.  You also get the same effect on the other side of the lunar disk as the   You should take your **camera** filter off at this point, **but leave your solar glasses on**.  Also, very important - **DO NOT LOOK THROUGH AN OPTICAL VIEWFINDER WHEN PHOTOGRAPHING THIS PHASE WITH AN UNFILTERED CAMERA** - use live view instead.  Any time any part of the photosphere is visible - even the little sliver associated with Bailey's Beads - your eyes need protection to look at it directly.

##### Prominences
Once you take the solar filter off your camera, you'll see prominences protruding away from the sun beyond the lunar limb.  Long focal lengths are best for these.

##### Earthshine
While it's not really visible to the unaided eye, long exposures will pick up detail of the moon's surface which is illuminated by light reflected off the earth.

##### The Corona
This is really why we care about total eclipses.  The sun's corona is always there, but normally invisible to us because it is many times dimmer than the bright photosphere which, along with Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere, completely washes it out.  It's incredibly beautiful.  It looks different in every eclipse depending on the highly variable magnetic field lines of the sun.  It has extreme variation in brightness as it extends away from the sun.  It extends away from the sun many times the diameter of the photosphere, so to capture it, you'll want a much wider field of view than you'd want for photogrpahing partial phases (or potentially several different fields of view)  I personally have some plans for 2024 based on some imagery I've seen using focal lengths [as wide as 85mm](https://hdr-astrophotography.com/2019-eclipse-large-field-of-view/).

#### Exposures During Totality
To the bit of the blog that's probalby most helpful, since you can't practice shooting a total eclipse.  The corona is extremely dynamic, very bright toward the center and dimly extending out many times the diameter of the sun's photosphere (the bright part).  I took a bunch of exposures during totality in 2017.  I put them together into a video here:

## How to Automate
As The key to following this advice and getting good images of totality is *automation*.  If you can automate the capture of different exposures at different times, then you can enjoy totality while your cameras click away without you having to mess with them during those precious moments.  A few options to consider:
 - **Intervalometer + Bracketing** - You can set up your camera to shoot bracketed exposures and then drive those with an intervalometer (interval timer) that you start right as totality begins.  This might be the easiest thing, but will make it a little tricky to capture things like Bailey's Beads that need quite different exposures than the corona.
 - [**Solar Eclipse Maestro**](http://xjubier.free.fr/en/site_pages/solar_eclipses/Solar_Eclipse_Maestro_Photography_Software.html) - I used this in 2017, but, apparently some of the libraries that this tool used are no longer supported and so it hasn't been developed for some time.  As a result, support tops out at macOS 10.14.x (Mojave), so unless you have an old Mac lying around you're willing to trust for the eclipse, it's not an option today.
 - [**CaptureEclipse**](https://almadenobservatory.net/CaptureEclipse/) - This is freely avialable on Apple's [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/captureeclipse/id1567295651) and supports modern MacOS versions.  Rob Hawley created it for his own needs after Solar Eclipse Maestro went out of support and was kind enough to share it.  It only supports (most) Canon cameras, and doesn't allow as fine-grained control as Solar Eclipse Maestro did - there are pre-programmed exposure sequences it runs through for each phase whereas SEM let you specify exactly what exposure you wanted to take when.  It also only supports one camera as best I can tell whereas SEM supported four.  Still, if you're on mac, use Canon, and want a turnkey option, this may be your best choice. 
 - **Home-rolled program** - I'm familiar with programming, so I downloaded the Canon EDSDK and am currently writing a program to drive multiple cameras.  It won't have a fancy GUI or options to automatically calculate eclipse phases from GPS coordinates in the program, but I'm hoping to make it reasonably general.  Not sure I'll distribute it, though.  I think most of the other major camera makers provide SDKs for controlling their cameras as well.
 
## Practice
Practice as much as you can.  Run through any automation you're going to do a few times to make sure you're getting all the exposures you expect to get.  Figure out what happens if a battery dies or a USB cable gets unplugged right before totality.  Does your camera refocus?  Do you have to restart some program?  Have a plan and checklist.  You only get one shot at totality - if you're experimenting and improvising you'll likely not get photos and you'll likely be distrated from enjoying the experience.  The next total eclipse to cross the United States like this won't be unitl 2045.

# Other Matters
Whether you photograph this event or not, I hope you enjoy it.  And in the midst of all the beauty and technical photography, don't forget to think about [deeper questions](https://rossmclendon.com/April8EclipsePlanning/#a-deeper-meaning) like *why* the moon blocking the sun is so beautiful.
