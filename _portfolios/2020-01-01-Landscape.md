More of a personal passion, and largely how I developed my photogrpahy - I love to seek out and capture beautiful moments and scenes in the world around me.  

Here are some examples of my landscape imagery.  Inquire about signed, limited prints on the prints page.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
{% for image in site.static_files %}
    {% if image.path contains 'images/portfolio/landscape' %}
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ image.path }}" alt="image" />
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</div>
