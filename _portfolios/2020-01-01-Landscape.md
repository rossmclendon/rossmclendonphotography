More of a personal passion, and largely how I developed my photogrpahy - I love to seek out and capture beautiful moments and scenes in the world around me.

Here are some examples of my landscape imagery.  Inquire about signed, limited prints on the [prints]({{ site.baseurl }}/prints) page.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
{% for image in site.static_files %}
    {% if image.path contains 'images/portfolio/landscape' %}
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ image.path }}" alt="image" />
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</div>
